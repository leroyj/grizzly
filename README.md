## Demo

You can play the game by visiting the [demo website](http://grizzly.djoo.org/)!

## Intent

This game is a fan art inspired by the animation serie Grizzly and the Lemmings from the talented french [Studio Hari](https://www.studiohari.com/).

This game follows three objectives:

* (re)learn to code
* my daughter (almost 6yo) to discover video game
* have fun

I will be happy if you enjoy it too.
